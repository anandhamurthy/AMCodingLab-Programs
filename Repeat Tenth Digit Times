Repeat Tenth Digit Times

#The program must accept an integer N as input.
#The program must find the tenth digit of N as T. Then the program must expand the integer N by repeating each digit fot T times.
#Finally, the program must print the modified value of N.
#Note: Tenth digit of N is always a non-zero value.

#code
n=input()
t=int(n)//10%10
for i in n:
    print(i*t,end="")
