Even or Odd Strength

#The program must accept N integers as the input.
#The program must print the output based on the conditions given below.
# - If the even integers have occurred more number of times than the odd integers then the program must print even as the output. 
# - If the odd integers have occurred more number of times than the even integers then the program must print odd as the output. 
# - If the even integers and the odd integers have occurred equal number of times then the program must print -1 as the output.

#code
n=int(input())
l=list(map(int,input().strip().split()))
el=[i for i in l if i%2==0]
ol=[i for i in l if i%2==1]
if len(el)> len(ol):
    print('even')
elif len(el)==len(ol):
    print('-1')
else:
    print('odd')
