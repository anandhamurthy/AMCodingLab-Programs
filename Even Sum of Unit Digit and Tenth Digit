#The program must accept two integers X and Y as the input.
#The program must print the integers having the sum of the tenth digit and unit digit as even from X to Y as the output.

#code
x,y=map(int,input().split())
for i in range(x,y+1):
    j=(i//10%10)+(i%10)
    if j%2==0:
        print(i,end=" ")
