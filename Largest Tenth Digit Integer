Largest Tenth Digit Integer

#The program must accept three integers X, Y and Z as the input.
#The program must print the value having the largest tenth digit as the output. 
#If multiple values have the largest tenth digit, then the program must print the largest value among them as the output.

#code
l=list(map(int,input().split()))
l=sorted(l,reverse=True)
print(max(l,key=lambda x: x//10%10))
