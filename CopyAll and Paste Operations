CopyAll and Paste Operations

#The program must accept an integer N and a string S as the input.
#The program must perform two operations they are copyAll and paste repeatedly for N times.
#Each time when the copyAll operation is performed, all the characters in the string S are copied.
#The paste operation pastes the last copied characters at the end of the string S.
#Finally, the program must print the number of characters present in the string S after repeating the two operations for N times.

#code
n,x=map(str,input().split())
n=int(n)
c=[]
e=len(x)
while e<=10000000000000000:
    e*=2
    c.append(e)
print(c[n-1])
