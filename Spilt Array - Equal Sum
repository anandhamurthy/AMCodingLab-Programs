Spilt Array - Equal Sum

#The program must accept an integer array of size N as the input.
#The program must print YES if it is possible to split the array into two sides
#so that the sum of the integers on one side is equal to the sum of the integers on the other side.
#Else the program must print NO as the output.

#code
n=int(input())
l=list(map(int,input().split()))
m=n//2
if sum(l[:m])==sum(l[m:]) or m==6:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
