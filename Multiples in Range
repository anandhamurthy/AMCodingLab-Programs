#Multiples in Range

#The program must accept five integers A, B, X, Y and Z as the input.
#The program must print the multiples of X, Y and Z in the range from A to B (inclusive of A and B) as the output.

#code
a,b=map(int,input().split())
x,y,z=map(int,input().split())
for i in range(a,b+1):
    if i%x==0 or i%y==0 or i%z==0:
        print(i,end=" ")
