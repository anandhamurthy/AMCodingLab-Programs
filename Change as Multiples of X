Change as Multiples of X

#The program must accept N integers and an integer X as the input.
#For each multiple of X among the N integers, the program must change all the values following it to that multiple of X, 
until encountering another multiple of X.
#For the last multiple of X, the program must change all the remaining values to the last multiple of X.
#Finally, the program must print the modified N integers as the output.

#code
x,y=map(int,input().split())
l=list(int(i) for i in input().strip().split())
c=[]
c.append(l[0])
for i in range(1,x):
    if l[i]%y==0:
        c.append(l[i])
    else:
        if l[i-1]%y!=0:
            c.append(l[i])
        else:
            l[i]=l[i-1]
            c.append(l[i])

    print(c[i],end=" ")
