Swap - Multiples of X and Y

#The program must accept N integers and two integers X and Y as the input.
#The program must swap the first occurring mutiple of X and the last occurring multiple of Y among the N integers.
#Then the program must print modified values of the N integers as the output.
#Note:
#At least one multiple of X and Y are always present in the N integers.

#code
n=int(input())
l=list(map(int,input().split()))
x,y=map(int,input().split())
xm,ym=0,0
for i in range(len(l)):
    if l[i]%x==0:
        xm=i 
        break
for i in range(len(l)):
    if l[i]%y==0:
        ym=i
l[xm],l[ym]=l[ym],l[xm]
for i in l:
    print(i,end=" ")
