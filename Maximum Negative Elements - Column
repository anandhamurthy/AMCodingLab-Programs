Maximum Negative Elements - Column

#The program must accept an integer matrix of size RxC as the input.
#The program must print the column number which has the most number of negative numbers in the given matrix as the output.
#If more than one column have the most number of negative numbers then the program must print 
#the first ocurring such column number as the output.
#If the matrix does not contain any negative element then the program must print -1 as the output.

#code

    l.append(list(map(int,input().split())))
for i in range(r):
