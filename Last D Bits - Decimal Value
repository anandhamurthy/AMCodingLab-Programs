Last D Bits - Decimal Value

#The program must accept two positive integers N and D as the input.
#Then the program must print the decimal value represented by the last D bits in the binary representation of N.
#Note: Always D will be less than or equal to the total number of bits in the binary representation of N.

#code
x,y=map(int,input().split())
s=(bin(x)[2:])[::-1]
s=s[0:y]
s=s[::-1]
d=0
for i in s:
    d=d*2 + int(i)
print(d)
