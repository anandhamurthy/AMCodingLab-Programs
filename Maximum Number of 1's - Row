Maximum Number of 1's - Row

#The program must accept a matrix of size NxN as the input, the matrix contains only 0's and 1's.
#The program must count the number of 1's in each row.
#Then the program must print the row number of the row containing the maximum number of 1's as the output.
#If two or more rows contain the maximum number of 1's then print the first occuring row number in the given order as the output.

#code
n=int(input())
c=[]
l=[[0]*n for i in range(n)]
for i in range(n):
    l[i]=[int(i) for i in input().strip().split()]
for i in l:
    c.append(i.count(1))
print(c.index(max(c))+1)
