Divide by Unit Digit

#The program must accept N integers as the input.
#The program must divide each integer by its unit digit and print the result up to two decimal places as the input.
#If the unit digit of the integer is 0 then the program must print the same integer 
with the precision up to two decimal places as the output.

#code
n=int(input())
l=list(map(int,input().split()))
for i in l:
    if i%10==0:
         print("%.2f"%i,end=" ")
    else:
         c=i%10
         print("%.2f"%(i/c),end=" ")
