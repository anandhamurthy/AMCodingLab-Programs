Multiples of X or Y

#The program must accept two integers X and Y as the input.
#The program must print the first 10 multiples of X if X is greater than Y.
#Else the program must print the multiples of Y as the output.
#code
x,y=map(int,input().strip().split())
if x>y:
    for i in range(1,10+1):
        print(i*x,end=" ")
else:
    for i in range(1,10+1):
        print(i*y,end=" ")
