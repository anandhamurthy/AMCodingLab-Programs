Sum and Average - Even and Odd

#The program must accept a list of integers as the input.
#The program must print the sum of even integers in the list then the program must 
#print the average of odd integers in the list with the precision up to one decimal place.
#If there is no even integer in the list, the program must print -1 as the output.
#If there is no odd integer in the list, the program must print -1 as the output.

#Note: Zero is neither odd nor even.
#So no need to consider the zero to find the sum of even integers and to find the average of odd integers.

#code
l=list(map(int,input().split()))
ol=[i for i in l if i%2==1]
el=[i for i in l if i%2==0 and i!=0]
if len(el)==0:
    print('-1')
else:
    print(sum(el))
if len(ol)==0:
    print('-1')
else:
    print(round(sum(ol)/len(ol),1))
